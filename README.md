## Welcome to Sesame
Sesame Compiler v1.0 Pre-Alpha

# What is Sesame Compiler?
Sesame Compiler's main purpose is to convert .sb3 (Scratch 3) files into C++.

# Why C++?
Well, C++ has a rich amount of built-in features unlike C, and even though its hard to understand, it is a language thats great for game development and high performance applications.

# Ok, but how do I install and run it?
Simple, you can use `git clone` to clone this repository, then you can run the Python file with `python sesame.py` and give the required directories for it to run.
